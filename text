Hi Anthony

I have a small project, will you be able to work on it this week?

I did most of it, but need some adjustments



2) About us page

d) Their text should be on 2 columns like the PSD




3) Our properties

b) on the address, on hover, can we see a small jpeg of the property?

You can don't have to fit the text, just do them all the same, I'll fill out the table


4) Contact
a) email address should go to info@reconrealties.com
b) map should show their address 5796 Ferrier, Suite 203, Montreal, QC H4P 1M7

Also please can you check the html files if you see any errors, I see some lines in red, maybe there are errors

Also please can you check if it shows correct as responsive, since we adjusted the layout, some things might need tweaking.

This is the FTP access
FTP: ftp.reconrealties.com
Username: reconrealtiex1

PW: Epurcell4_0

Thank you very much.
